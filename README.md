### Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne ~ Widescreen Launcher 

This launcher is based on an older **widescreen fix** by **ThirteenAG** --- you should now use the latest version at [https://thirteenag.github.io](https://thirteenag.github.io/wfp#mp2), along with my latest [**UniGame Launcher**](https://github.com/alex47exe/UniGame-Launcher/releases)
